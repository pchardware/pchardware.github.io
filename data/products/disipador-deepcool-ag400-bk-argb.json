This perfect ratio facilitates a highly efficient phase change throughout the heat pipe and achieves lower thermal resistance over a wide TDP range.\n\n\nFind your optimal balance with automatic PWM support for full performance under load to silent efficiency at idle.\n500-2000 RPM\n≤31.6 dB(A)\n75.89 CFM\n\n\nThe included mounting brackets support both Intel and AMD platforms with an easy five-step installation process that maintains great contact pressure. The offset design of the heat pipes ensures that the cooler can be installed with the fan already attached.\n\nProduct Dimensions\t125×92×150 mm(L×W×H)\nHeatsink Dimensions\t120×92×150 mm(L×W×H)\nNet Weight\t614 g\nHeatpipe\tØ6 mm×4 pcs\nFan Dimensions\t120×120×25 mm(L×W×H)\nFan Speed\t500~2000 RPM±10%\nFan Airflow\t75.89 CFM\nFan Air Pressure\t2.53 mmAq\nFan Noise\t≤31.6 dB(A)\nFan Connector\t4-pin PWM\nBearing Type\tHydro Bearing\nFan Rated Voltage\t12 VDC\nFan Rated Current\t0.28 A\nFan Power Consumption\t3.36 W\nLED Type\tAddressable RGB LED\nLED Connector\t3-pin(+5V-D-G)\nLED Rated Voltage\t5 VDC\nLED Power Consumption\t1.05 W\nEAN\t6933412727774\nP/N\tR-AG400-BKANMC-G-2","Price":60.00,"Features":[],"Date":"2025-11-10T09:32:24.1726794-05:00","Update":"2025-11-10T09:59:51.4394623-05:00","Label":"Disipador DeepCool AG400 BK ARGB"}

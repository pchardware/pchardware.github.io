For quad-channel motherboards, the rear slots have a clearance of 45mm.\n\nCool, Quiet, and Powerful\nAchieve high-performance cooling with minimal noise levels thanks to the included FK120 fan that maximizes airflow and static pressure when needed and intelligently ramps down for silent efficiency. An optional low-speed adapter and extra fan clips are included for upgrades.\n\nSimple and Secure\nThe provided all metal mounting bracket provides an easy installation process that ensures proper contact and equal pressure on both Intel and AMD platforms.\n\nApplication For \nIntel LGA2066/2011-v3/2011/1851/1700/1200/1151/1150/1155\nAMD AM5/AM4\n\nTechnical Spec\nProduct Dimensions\t127×117×158 mm(L×W×H)\nHeatsink Dimensions\t127×90×158 mm(L×W×H)\nNet Weight\t1040 g\nHeatpipe\tØ6 mm×5 pcs\nFan Dimensions\t120×120×25 mm(L×W×H)\nFan Speed\t500~1850 RPM±10%\nFan Airflow\t68.99 CFM\nFan Air Pressure\t2.19 mmAq\nFan Noise\t≤31.5 dB(A)\nFan Speed (with LSP)\t500~1550 RPM±10%\nFan Airflow (with LSP)\t52.24 CFM\nFan Air Pressure (with LSP)\t1.2 mm\nAqFan Noise (with LSP)\t≤25.9 dB(A)\nFan Connector\t4-pin PWM\nBearing Type\tFluid Dynamic Bearing\nFan Rated Voltage\t12 VDC\nFan Rated Current\t0.12 A\nFan Power Consumption\t1.44 W","Price":75.00,"Features":["DigitalScreen","ARGB","5 Head Pipes","69cfm","Fluid Bearing","28dba","160mm","1850rpm","PWM","AM5","AM4","LGA1700","LGA1200","LGA1851","LGA115X"],"Date":"2025-12-12T20:34:02.8057155-05:00","Update":"2025-12-15T07:13:04.2899957-05:00","Label":"Disipador DeepCool AK500"}

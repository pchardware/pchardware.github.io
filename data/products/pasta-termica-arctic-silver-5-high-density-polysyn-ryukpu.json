  "Description": "Model\nBrand: Arctic Silver\nModel: AS5-3.5G\n\n\nDetails\nVolume / Net Weight: 3.5g\nLong Term Operating Temperature: -50 to 130 C\nSpecifications: Average Particle Size:\n< 0.49 micron < 0.000020 inch\n\nExtended Temperature Limits:\nPeak: -50 Celsius Degree to >180 Celsius Degree \nLong-Term: -50 Celsius Degree to 130 Celsius Degree\n\nPerformance:\n3 to 12 degrees centigrade lower CPU full load core temperatures than standard thermal compounds or thermal pads when measured with a calibrated thermal diode imbedded in the CPU core.\n\nCoverage Area:\nA 3.5 gram syringe contains enough compound to cover at least 15 to 25 small CPU cores, or 6 to 10 large CPU cores, or 2 to 5 heat plates. At a layer 0.003\" thick, the 3.5 gram syringe will cover approximately 16 square inches.\n\n\nFeatures\nFeatures: Three unique shapes and sizes of pure silver particles to maximize particle-to-particle contact area and thermal transfer.\nContains over 88% thermally conductive filler by weight. These thermally-enhanced ceramic particles improve the compound's performance and long-term stability.\nEnsure the best physical contact between the heatsink and the CPU core.\nWill not separate, run, migrate, or bleed.",

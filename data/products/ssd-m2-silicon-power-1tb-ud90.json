  "Description": "Model\nBrand: Silicon Power\nModel: UD90\nPart Number: SU01KGBP44UD9005SN\nDevice Type: Internal Solid State Drive (SSD)\nUsed For: Consumer\n\n\nDetails\nForm Factor: M.2 2280\nCapacity: 1TB\nMemory Components: 3D NAND\nInterface: PCI-Express 4.0 x4\n\n\nPerformance\nMax Sequential Read: Up to 5000 MBps\nMax Sequential Write: Up to 4800 MBps\nTerabytes Written (TBW): 600TB\nMTBF: 1,500,000 hours\nHeatSink: No\n\n\nFeatures\nFeatures: To bolster its multi-tasking factor even further, the UD90 takes advantage of increased bandwidth when used in conjunction with motherboards equipped with PCIe 4.0 slots. In fact, it has nearly double the bandwidth of PCIe 3.0 for shorter download times and the ability to download more files within the same amount of time.\n\nAn SSD's speed is meaningless without the ability to handle that speed reliably. The UD90 achieves improved sequential read/write and random read/write performance with support for SLC Caching. At the same time, it supports low density parity check (LDPC) coding to ensure accuracy of data transmission and reliability of data access.\n\nThe UD90 supports RAID to protect data in the case of a drive failure. It's also equipped with built-in E2E data protection for enhanced data transfer integrity. Unexpected things can happen at any moment, but the UD90 is prepared for them with your data at its utmost priority.\n\n5-year limited warranty\n\n\nEnvironmental\nOperating Temperature: 0°C ~ +70°C\nMax Shock Resistance: 1500g/0.5ms",

  "Description": "16 Port Chain Sync Breakout Board + PCIe Cables for HP, DELTA, LITE-ON Server Power Supplies\n\nThis server power supply adapter kit is built with our patented ZSX Amp breakout board and your choice in high-quality PCIe cables for ASIC or GPU mining.\n\nCable Option 1: 6 Pin PCIE to 6 Pin PCIE  (Typically used with ASIC Mining)\nCable Option 2: 6 Pin PCIE to 8 Pin (6+2) (ASIC or GPU Mining)\n\nBuilt from its predecessor, the ZSX AMP retains the quality of the ZSX while adding several new features not seen in the industry. It is backward compatible as a replacement for the ZSX, X8, X6B, X7B, and X11.\n\nThe AMP version displays the total DC amperage as well as Voltages. Users now have the ability to know their DC watts output.  The X11 Amp is the breakout board for built for ASIC or GPU Mining.\n\nEasily calculate your wattage use with a simple formula.\nCurrent x Voltage = Watts     e.g. 70 Current multiplied by 12v equals 900 watts.\n\n    Standalone combining three specific components into one: ATX 24pin power connector, X11 Breakout Board, and Fan Hubs\n    Optional XRMT-V1 remote management add-on module is available. While these boards are interconnected, use the remote power management module to remotely manage ON-OFF / Schedule Restart.\n    Optional 4-pin PWM cable to allow your motherboard to regulate fan speeds accordingly to current temperatures detected, instead of the connected fans running constantly at 100% speed.\n\nATX Module Adapter Connector:\n\n    Live Amp reading directly on the ZSX / Minimum 20amps for accuracy \n    Read  Ohms Article to understand AC load & DC Load differences\n    24Pin ATX Connectors W/ 24in Cable\n    180watts limit on wattage draw from the 24pins ATX connectors\n    4Pin Molex Female\n    SATA Power for your SSD\n    4Pin or 8pin CPU Power\n\nBreakout Board Specifications:\n\n    PWM can control fans RPM via motherboard when connect to the Chassis fan\n    Support up to 140Amp / 1600Watts\n    Electronic on /off switch. Retains its state\n    16 PCIe ports, for 6pin connectors\n    LED indicator lights: Yellow (receiving power), Green (pushing power) & Blue (Motherboard powered)\n    On-board LED voltmeter and current displays! Current x Voltage = Watts\n        Please note this is most accurate on loads over 500W\n    Protective bottom plate\n    Our Patent Pending Chain Sync Feature through our X6B, X7B,  X11, and ZSX Breakout boards is done by connecting the interconnect cable from PSU 1 to PSU2, PSU 2 to PSU 3, and so on. Feature tested with up to 20 PSU in a Daisy Chain.\n\n6 Pin PCIe Cable Option 1 Specifications:\nGauge \t16AWG\nLength \t24in\nMax Amperage \t12A\nMax Wattage \t400W\nConnector A \t6Pin PCIe Male\nConnector B \t6Pin PCIe Male\nColor \tWhite (positive) and Black (ground)\n6 Pin to 8 Pin PCIe Cable Option 2 Specifications:\nGauge \t16AWG\nLength \t24in\nMax Amperage \t12A\nMax Wattage \t400W\nConnector A \t6Pin PCIe Male\nConnector B \t8(6+2)Pin PCIe Male\nColor \tYellow (positive) and Black (ground)\nPackage Contents:\n\n    (1) ZSX Amp Breakout Board\n    (1) 24-pin ATX/CPU power cable\n    (1) Molex to SATA/Molex splitter\n    (4, 6, 8, 10, 12, or 16) PCIe cables of your choice in either 6-pin or 6+2pin PCIe\n    30-day warranty\n\nPower Supply Compatibility List\n\n    Note: Not compatible with Dell power supply with Dell Part Numbers: TCVRR, 0GVHPX, or 0XCHHD.\n    460 Watts:\n        DPS-460EB A, HSTNS-PD14, HSTNS-PL14, 499249-001, 499250-101, 499250-201, 511777-001, 503296-B21, HSTNS-PL23B, PS-2461-6C1-LF, 591553-001, 591555-201, 599381-001, DPS-460MB A, HSTNS-PL28, PS-2461-7C-LF, 643931-001, 643954-201, 660184-001, 656362-B21, HSTNS-PR28-AD, HSTNS-PL28-AD, 7001613-J100, 746071-001, 748279-201, 748279-301, 742515-001, 739252-B21\n    750 Watts:\n        DPS-750RB-A, HSTNS-PL18, 506821-001, 506822-201, 511778-001, 512327-B21, DPS-750RB-A, HSTNS-PD18, 506822-101, 506821-001, 511778-001, 512327-B21, HSTNS-PL12, 449838-001, 449840-001, 454353-001, DPS-750AB-4 A, HSTNS-PD31, 674890-001, 666375-101, 674275-B21, DPS-750UB B, HSTNS-PD22B, 591556-101, 591554-001, 599383-001, 593831-B21, DPS-750AB-3 A, HSTNS-PD29, 643932-001, 643955-101, 660183-001, 656363-B21, HSTNS-PL29-AD, PS-2751-7CB-LF, 746072-001, 748281-201, 742516-001, 739254-B21, HSTNS-PF04, HPM-S-0750DDL00, 619671-401, 639173-001, 636673-B21, HSTNS-PL34, PS-2751-9C-LF, 697579-001, 700287-001, 697554-201, 697581-B21\n    1100 Watts:\n        03MJJP, 0Y613G, 01Y45R, L1100A-S0, PS-2112-2D-LF, PS-2112-2D1-LF, 09PG9X, 0W933G, PS-2112-2L, 0XVKF0, PS-2112-2L LF, 09K3M9\n    1200 Watts:\n        DPS-1200LB C, MVKTR-LF, DPS-1200FB A, HSTNS-PD11, 440785-001, 438202-001, 438202-002, HSTNS-PL30, 643933-001, DPS-1200FB-1 A, HSTNS-PD19, 570451-001, 570451-101, 579229-001, DPS-1200SB A, HSTNS-PD30, 643933-001, 643956-101, 660185-001, 643956-201, 656364-B21\n    1400 Watts:\n        PS-2142-2L, PS-2142-2L LF, 0Y53VG, DPS-1200MB A, D1200E-S0, 0MYV71, 04V04J, DPS-1200MB-1 A, D1200E-S1, 0RN0HH, 0CN35N, DPS-1200MB-1 B, D1200E-S2, 0J8HPV, 0FRVCP, DPS-1200MB-1 C\n    1500 Watts:\n        HSTNS-PL33, PS-2152-1C-LF, 684529-001, 684530-201, 704604-001, 684532-B21",
